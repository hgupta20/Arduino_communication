# Arduino_communication
Be able to have two Arduinos communicate with each other
connect two Arduino's via a hardwired serial connection (no usb cable) (digital pins 0 and 1)
* connect a button and an external LED to each device
* pressing the button on one Arduino should cause the other Arduino's LED to change state
  (on to off, or off to on)
* Button press on one Arduino should toggle the state of the LED on the other (on/off) and not
  keep the LED lit while being pressed
* utilize the 16x2 display for debugging
* refer to lab 6 for all the info about serial communication and lab2 for maintaining led states
 with button presses .
